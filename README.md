## üìÇ Folder Organizer

This project is a Python script that automatically organizes the files in your Downloads/Descargas folder into subfolders based on their type (images, videos, documents, music, etc.).

## üöÄ Features
	‚Ä¢	Automatically detects whether your folder is named Downloads or Descargas.
	‚Ä¢	Classifies files into categories:
	‚Ä¢	Images (.jpg, .png, .gif, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Videos (.mp4, .avi, .mkv, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Music (.mp3, .wav, .flac, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Documents (.pdf, .docx, .xlsx, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Archives (.zip, .rar, .7z, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Files that don‚Äôt match any category are moved to the Others folder.
	‚Ä¢	If a file with the same name already exists, the script appends a number to avoid overwriting it.

‚∏ª

## üìã Requirements
	‚Ä¢	Python 3.8+
	‚Ä¢	Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
	‚Ä¢	No need to install external libraries (uses only Python standard libraries).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
	‚Ä¢	This script moves files, it does not copy them.
	‚Ä¢	If you want to test it safely, you can create a test folder with sample files and change the carpeta_objetivo variable in the code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Extra

You can customize it to organize into more folders, subfolders, or even target a different directory than Downloads, with different file types. This version was built for personal use.
